# STMP

STMP (silly terminal music player) is, as the name suggests, a terminal music player.

## Usage

TODO: currently the music player is setup to be run on my machine with no-one else's.

## Requirements

STMP uses Deno for the majority of the code, and SDL2_Mixer (SDL2 is a requirement) for the backend. It is recommended to use a nerd font with ligatures.
